# Issues with Clang C++ compiler when compiling Vector Class Library

### intrinsic vector types not distinguished  
The Clang compiler treats the intrinsic vector types __m128, __m128i, and __m128d as identical,
where all other compilers treat them as different, in accordance with Intel manuals.
I have reported this problem in 2013 but it is still not fixed in july 2019.
A fix may be underway.  
Work around in instrset.h: #define FIX_CLANG_VECTOR_ALIAS_AMBIGUITY

### Mask registers in inline assembly  
The compiler sometimes puts mask registers in inline assembly where a general purpose register is required.  
Work around in instrset.h: bit_scan_forward function given __ attribute __((noinline))

### Compiler crash on Vector3d rotate function with AVX instruction set  
Bug tracing: <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42898>  
Fixed in version 8.

### Cygwin clang crashes on long double mathematical functions  
The cygwin64 version of clang causes crash on long double mathematical functions such as sqrtl, powl, etc.

### Cygwin clang cannot compile template with 64 parameters  
The cygwin64 version of clang has problems compiling the permute64 function

### Suboptimal use of 64-bit absolute addresses in Cygwin Clang  
This is not a bug, but suboptimal code.  
There appears to be confusion over which memory model to use.
