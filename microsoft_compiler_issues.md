# Issues with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ compiler when compiling Vector Class Library

### Vector parameters not aligned  
Older versions of MS compiler cannot have vectors as function parameters.  
You get error messages like "error C2719: formal parameter with \_\_declspec(align('16')) won't be aligned"  
Fixed in later versions

### Cannot specify instruction set on command line  
Visual Studio version 19 cannot specify instruction sets higher than "/arch:AVX2" on the command line.  
It is still possible to code for higher instruction sets by using instrinsic functions, but there is
not check that the code matches a particular instruction set.  
Version 2022 supports "/arch:AVX512", but not all subsets.

### Code compiled for AVX512F includes AVX512DQ instructions  
A consequence of the previous issue is that Visual Studio may issue instructions beyond AVX512F when compiling for AVX512F.  
Example:  
```cpp
#define INSTRSET 9  // AVX512F
#include "vectorclass.h"
Vec8d test (Vec8d a, Vec8d b) {
    return select (a > b && a < b+1, a, b);
}
```  
Visual Studio version 19 is issuing kmovb instructions when compiling this.  
This program will crash on a CPU with AVX512F only, because the kmovb instruction belongs to the
AVX512DQ instruction set.

The reply from Microsoft so far is not assuring (2019-08-04)
